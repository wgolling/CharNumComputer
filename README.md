# Characteristic Numbers Computer

This project is meant to perform particular computations in the field of Algebraic Topology.  Specifically it computes the characteristic classes and characteristic numbers of type Chern, Stiefel-Whitney, and Pontryagin, for any product of complex projective spaces.  At a more basic level the software models the arithmetic of truncated polynomials rings, and then the general functionality is applied to this specific problem.  A small demo is included in the [main](https://github.com/wgolling/CharNumComputer/blob/master/NetBeansProjects/CharNumComputer/src/charnumcomputer/CharNumComputer.java) file.

The audience for this project is people working in or around the theory of Manifolds who have a need for these computations: a very narrow demographic.  It was mostly written for a personal project and for developing coding skills.

The [math backgroud](https://github.com/wgolling/CharNumComputer/blob/master/NetBeansProjects/CharNumComputer/mathbackground.pdf) file contains a bit of exposition of how these terms fit together, but no effort is made there to explain what they mean.  It is recomended that you download the pdf rather than try to read it in github's pdf reader (at least it works very poorly for me).  The interested reader is strongly encouraged to study Topology in general.
